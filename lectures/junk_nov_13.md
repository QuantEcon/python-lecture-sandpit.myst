In the left panel, the red line is our tool for computing  the mathematical expectation for different
values  of $\pi$.

The green lot indicates the mathematical expectation of $\exp\left(\frac{-u\left(c\right)}{\theta}\right)$ 
when $\pi = .5$.  

Notice that the distance between the green dot  and the curve is greater in the transformed space than the original space as a result of additional curvature. 

The inverse transformation  $\theta\log E\left[\exp\left(\frac{-u\left(c\right)}{\theta}\right)\right]$ generates  the green dot on the left panel that constitutes the risk-sensitive utility  index.  

The gap between the green dot and the red line on the left panel measures the additional adjustment for risk
that risk-sensitive preferences make relative to plain vanilla expected utility preferences. 






${\sf T} u(c)$ as a function of $\pi_1$ for $\theta=100$ (nearly linear line) and $\theta=.6$ (convex curved line). Here  $I=2, c_1=2, c_2=1$, $u(c) = \ln c$.
